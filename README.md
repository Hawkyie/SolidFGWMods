### Slow Motion
* Hold F to enable slow motion (Note: Speed is default by 0. So game looks its frozen, but it is actually working all right)
* Press O to speed up.
* Press L to slow down speed.
Current speed limits are 1.00-0.01 from real time speeds and you move 0.02 steps for each press.

Note: Bullet drops are currently tied up with IRL time. The slower is game speed, the bigger is the bullet drop.
